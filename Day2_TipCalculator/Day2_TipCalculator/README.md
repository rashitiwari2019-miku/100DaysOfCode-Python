# Day 2: Tip Calculator 💰

This is my second Python mini-project from the 100 Days of Code Bootcamp.  
It calculates how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including a tip.

## 🧠 What It Does
- Takes user input for:
  - Total bill amount
  - Tip percentage (10, 12, or 15)
  - Number of people to split the bill
- Calculates:
  - Tip amount
  - Total bill including tip
  - Amount each person should pay
- Rounds the result to 2 decimal places for clarity

## 🖥️ Sample Output
Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? $150 
What percentage tip would you like to give? 12 
How many people to split the bill? 5
Each person should pay: $33.6
